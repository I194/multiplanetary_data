# Multiplanetary Data

Open-source knowledge base for **multiplanetary life** â€” agriculture, engineering, habitat design, space medicine, psychology and every other discipline required to settle new worlds.
All articles feed directly into the content pipeline for **[multiplanetarization.com](https://www.multiplanetarization.com/)**, an independent project tracking humanityâ€™s progress toward living on multiple planets.

Every contribution is a standalone article stored as Markdown plus local media inside the `articles/` directory.

## Repository Layout

```text
articles/
  my-article-slug/
    article.md
    cover.jpg|png|webp
    optional-media.*
```

## Writing an Article

1. Create a new folder inside `articles/` named after your topic in *kebab-case* (lowercase words separated by hyphens).
2. Add an `article.md` file that follows the front-matter schema below.
3. Place a `cover` image in the same folder and reference it from the front matter (`cover: cover.jpg`).
4. Commit, push, and open a Pull Request (PR) against `main`.

### Front Matter Schema

```yaml
---
title: Your Article Title               # Required
date: YYYY-MM-DD                        # ISO-8601, UTC
description: One-sentence abstract      # â‰¤120 characters
importance: 1â€“10                        # Subjective priority
cover: cover.jpg                        # File present in folder
---
```

### Front Matter Fields Explained

| Field      | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `title`    | Article headline shown on multiplanetarization.com |
| `date`     | Publication date (ISO-8601) used for sorting |
| `description` | Concise abstract for previews/meta tags |
| `importance` | Editorial priority **1 (low) â€“ 10 (top)**; higher numbers surface sooner on the homepage |
| `cover`    | Local image file displayed as the article banner |

### Recommended Markdown Skeleton

<!-- Optional: replace the list below with your own key points -->
## Why <Topic> (optional)

- Point 1  <!-- example placeholder -->
- Point 2

```

### Style Guide

* Plain Markdown only; avoid raw HTML except the occasional `<br>` if you really need a line break.
* Use local images (`![alt](image.png)`) rather than external links so that the repo stays self-contained.
* Keep each image **â‰¤ 1 MB** â€” this is mandatory both for quick page loads on multiplanetarization.com and for a lightweight repository.
* Prefer tables for numeric data or comparisons.
* Keep line length â‰¤120 characters to ease diff reviews.
* Cite your sources â€“ science is better with references.
* To embed a full-width **YouTube** video, put the URL on its own line with no Markdown formatting (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`). Most Markdown engines will auto-embed it.

## Contributing Workflow

1. Fork this repository and create a topic branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-article
   ```
2. Add your article and commit your changes.
3. Push the branch and open a Pull Request to `main`.
