# Martian Regolith from Arcadia Planitia – First‑Generation Simulant for Early Colonies

> "If we want SpaceX's first crew to plant salad on Sol‑30, the seeds need to meet the dirt before the rocket ever leaves Earth."

## Why Arcadia Planitia?
	
- **Chosen landing zone** – Musk & co. favour Arcadia because it's flat like a parking lot and sits just below datum (–3 to –4 km), trimming velocity on landing burns and leaving plenty of solar hours.
- **Ice in the backyard** – Ground‑penetrating radar shows a continent‑sized ice sheet a metre or two beneath the surface. Basiacally a free water and radiation shielding.
- **Starter pressure, but not too much** – Ambient pressure hovers around 7–8 mbar: lower than Hellas, but enough to take the edge off greenhouse wall forces once you inflate to 200 mbar.
- **Focus** – rapid‑cycle crops and nursery stock: lettuce, radish, wheat, dwarf tomatoes. Trees come later; here we care about speed and scalability.

## The basalt problem

A follow‑up clip shows me burning an afternoon hammering 10–15 cm basalt chunks into 0.1-1 cm gravel – and still nowhere near the 0.1–0.3 mm dust that dominates Martian regolith. Buy pre‑milled basalt or rent a mortar grinder. Don't waste your time.

## Recipe
1. Basalt dust (50 %) – opt for 0.1–0.3 mm. The video shows why.
2. Quartz sand (25 %) – 0.4–0.8 mm adds skeleton and SiO₂.
3. Red Fe₂O₃ pigment (10 %) – iron + the iconic colour.
4. Dolomite flour (8 %) – CaCO₃ + MgO, buffers pH.
5. Gypsum (CaSO₄, 3 %) – matches Martian sulfate load.
6. Epsom salt (MgSO₄, 2 %) – extra Mg and sulfate.
7. Bentonite clay (2 %) – water retention.
8. Coarse basalt chips (trace) – 1 cm stones for realism/aeration.
9. NaCl (≤ 1 %) – optional trace chlorides; skipped in this batch.

Total mass ≈ 1 kg. Cost ≤ 5 USD. Build time ~30 min if you buy the basalt dust.

## Mental hygiene: why dirt equals sanity

Plants aren't just calories; they're a piece of Earth for the brain. A park‑size greenhouse under a thin sky beats grey walls and red dust for crew morale. That's why even this fast‑crop simulant matters – it seeds the psyche as much as the soil.

## Arcadia vs. Hellas in one breath

| Parameter | Arcadia Planitia | Hellas Basin |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| Elevation | –3 km | –7 km |
| Surface Pressure | 7–8 mbar | 11–12 mbar |
| Ice Availability | High (shallow subsurface) | Moderate |
| Greenhouse Focus | Short-cycle annuals | Long-lived trees |
| Simulant Grain Size | Coarser basalt preferred | Finer, clay-rich |
| Stress on Dome Walls | Higher | Lower |
