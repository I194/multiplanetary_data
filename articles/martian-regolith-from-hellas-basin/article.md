# Martian Regolith from Hellas Basin – A Tree-First Simulant for Large-Scale Greenhouses

> *"If we ever cover Mars in orchards, the first saplings will have cut their roots in a bucket here on Earth."*

## Why Hellas Basin?

- **Highest natural pressure on Mars** – the basin floor sits ~7 km below datum. Wintertime surface pressure reaches **≈ 11–12 mbar**, about **2 ×** the planetary average. 
- **Megadome advantage** – for a 200 mbar interior (enough for many temperate trees under high-O₂, low-N₂ mixes) the stress on walls in Hellas is ~5 % lower than at datum and ~10 % lower than on high plateaus. Spread over **hundreds of hectares**, that translates into thousands of tonnes of saved steel or polymer.
- **Target crops** – not quick leafy greens but **full forests and orchards**: apple, poplar, birch, pine… Species that lock carbon, build soil, and last decades.

Hence this simulant is tuned **first** for woody perennials—deep roots, long lifespans—and **then** for annuals.

## Step-by-step Recipe (verbatim from the original X post)

1. **Basalt backbone** – crush volcanic gravel/“lava rock” to a dust-to-sand mix (< 0.1 mm – 2 mm).  
2. **Quartz filler** – equal volume of washed quartz sand.  
3. **Iron oxide** – ~10 % red Fe₂O₃ pigment for chemistry *and* colour.  
4. **Alkalinity buffers** – CaCO₃ powder (garden lime, chalk) + a pinch of Mg-sulfate (Epsom salt) to push pH ≈ 8–9.  
5. **Clay fraction** – **20–30 % bentonite** (cheap clumping cat-litter) to boost water-holding capacity for trees.  
6. **Trace salts** – 1 tsp NaCl + 1–2 Tbsp gypsum per 5 L batch.  
7. **Mix, lightly mist to keep dust down, then bake at 120–150 °C for 2–3 h** to sterilise.

> **Safety note** – wear a dust mask & gloves when handling fine powders.

Initial test species: dwarf apple (Malus 'M9'), Scots pine seedlings, Lombardy poplar cuttings.  
Log pH, EC, Ca/Mg leaching and root tensile strength.

## Example Simulant Blends

| Region / Use-case | Basaltic Lava Rock (%) | Quartz Sand (%) | Fe₂O₃ Pigment (%) | CaCO₃ (%) | Bentonite Clay (%) | Sulfate Salts (%) | Target pH | Texture / Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------------:|----------------:|------------------:|----------:|-------------------:|------------------:|----------:|-----------------|
| Arcadia Planitia – fast greens | 50 | 25 | 10 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 8.3 | Coarse, sand-dominated; drainage > water retention |
| **Hellas Basin – tree orchards** | 35 | 20 | 8 | 10 | **15** | 10 | 7.5 | Finer, clay-rich; mimics aqueous alteration, holds moisture for deep roots |
